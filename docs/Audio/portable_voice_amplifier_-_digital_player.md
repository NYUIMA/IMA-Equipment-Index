## Description

The worlds smallest amplifier \(140g/0\.308lb, 6\.8\*3\.9\*1\.1/in\), strong enough even for a large classroom\.

Waistband amplifiers are typically lightweight, which makes them portable, so carrying them around is a cinch, as all you have to do is clip them to your belt or use the handy shoulder straps provided\.

Using the right waistband amplifier can relieve your voice of the heavy burden\. Ideally, we recommend a personal voice amplifier kit for tour guides, instructors, youth counselors, teachers, professors, kindergarten staff, and clowns etc

High volume amplification, low feedback from microphone, and amazing sound clarity are some of its features\. It runs on rechargeable batteries that provide power output\.

The Aux/Line In port allows you to use this device to amplify an external music player such cell phones, laptops, MP3 players\.
