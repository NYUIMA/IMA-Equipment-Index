The adjustable mics, four\-track recording and extended battery life of the TASCAM DR\-40 give you the flexibility you need to record tracks anywhere\.



The DR\-40 captures up to four tracks from built\-in, high\-quality condenser microphones, XLR mic or line inputs\. The internal mics are adjustable from XY to AB position, helping you to tailor your recording to the sound of the room\. A pair of great\-sounding TASCAM microphone preamps welcome condenser microphones with phantom power, recording at up to 96kHz/24\-bit resolution\.
