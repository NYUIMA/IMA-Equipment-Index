## Description

The FP6020\-II's unique design offers a narrow sound dispersion pattern with true stereo separation\. It can be suspended from the ceiling in libraries, at information kiosks, and similar areas where information needs to be delivered to a handful of listeners without bleeding out into the surrounding area\.

 

 The speaker features twin 1"" aluminum full\-range drivers, mounted in individually sealed compartments inside SoundTube's 20"" patented ZeroReflection™ dome enclosure\. The drivers point upward and reflect sound off of the dome's interior to produce a narrow, focused 30° coverage angle\. The enclosure includes a built\-in switchable 350Hz high\-pass filter\.
