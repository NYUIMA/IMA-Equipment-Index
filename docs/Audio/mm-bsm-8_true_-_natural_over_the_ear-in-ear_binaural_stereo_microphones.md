## Description

The \(MM\-BSM\-8\) True & Natural over the ear on in\-ear stereo microphones that will give you the "most" realistic and accurate binaural stereo recordings\!



Totally flexible and form fitting the \(MM\-BSM\-8\) will give you hours of comfortable recordings hands free\! Microphones install quick and easily over the ear and slide into the opening of each ear\. When installed correctly microphones will not fall out\! Comes standard gold plated 1/8" stereo plug for even greater flexibility\. Cable lengths are 52"\.



\*In\-Ear Binaural Stereo Microphones "do not" block your hearing ability\!



These microphones have a very naturally crisp sound, providing deep bass, smooth mid\-range and clean high\-range with a frequency response of typically \+/\-2dB\. They can be easily plugged into any Minidisc, Dat or analog recorder that supplies a bias voltage of between 1\.5 to 10 volts D\.C\. \(also known as plug in power\) at the microphone input jack\.



Excellent for the following recorders but not limited to: Edirol R9, Kodak Zi8 HD pocket video camera, Olympus DS\-40, Olympus LS\-10, Tascam DR\-01, Tascam DR\-03, Tascam DR\-07, Yamaha CX, Zoom H1, Zoom H2 and Zoom H4N\.



Note: If your recorder does not provide a bias voltage or if you want to feed your recorders line inputs to avoid overloading your recorder's mic pre\-amplifier, you can use one of our Battery Modules \(check out our Battery\-Module Section\)\.



Battery Modules will power the microphones with optimum power \( 9 volts D\.C \), increase dynamic range and enable the mics to handle higher \(SPL\) sound pressure levels \( loud sounds \) without distortion\.
