## Description

WHAT IS DVI ?

DVI stands for \(D\)igital \(V\)ideo \(I\)nterface\.DVI is a popular form of video interface technology made to maximize the quality of flat panel LCD monitors and modern video graphics cards\. It was a replacement for the short\-lived P&D Plug & Display standard, and a step up from the digital\-only DFP format for older flat panels\. DVI cables are very popular with video card manufacturers, and most cards nowadays include one or two DVI output ports\.



In addition to being used as the standard computer interface, the DVI standard was, for a short while, the digital transfer method of choice for HDTVs and other high\-end video displays for TV, movies, and DVDs\. Likewise, even a few top\-end DVD players have featured DVI outputs in addition to the high\-quality analog Component Video\. The digital market has now settled on the HDMI interface for high\-definition media delivery, with DVI being more exclusive to the computer market\.
