## Description

Here is a design for a full\-featured motor shield that will be able to power many simple to medium\-complexity projects\.







2 connections for 5V 'hobby' servos connected to the Arduino's high\-resolution dedicated timer \- no jitter\!

4 H\-Bridges: L293D chipset provides 0\.6A per bridge \(1\.2A peak\) with thermal shutdown protection, internal kickback protection diodes\. Can run motors on 4\.5VDC to 25VDC\.

Up to 4 bi\-directional DC motors with individual 8\-bit speed selection \(so, about 0\.5% resolution\)

Up to 2 stepper motors \(unipolar or bipolar\) with single coil, double coil or interleaved stepping\.

Pull down resistors keep motors disabled during power\-up

Big terminal block connectors to easily hook up wires \(18\-26AWG\) and power

Arduino reset button brought up top

2\-pin terminal block and jumper to connect external power, for separate logic/motor supplies

Tested compatible with Arduino Mega 1280 & 2560, Diecimila, Duemilanove, and UNO
