# Particle Photon

![particle_photon](/img/boards/particle_photon.png)

## Basic information

**Brand**: DFRobot

**Product page**: [https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1324.html#.VkrMOXYrLIU](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1324.html#.VkrMOXYrLIU)

**Documentation**: [https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/wi-fi/photon-datash...](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/wi-fi/photon-datasheet/)

## Description

The tools that make up the Photon's ecosystem \(and come along with the board\) are designed to let you build and create whether you're an embedded engineer, web developer, Arduino enthusiast or IoT entrepreneur\. You'll be able to write your firmware in our web or local IDE, deploy it over the air, and build your web and mobile apps with ParticleJS and our Mobile SDK\.



The board itself uses a Broadcom wi\-fi chip \(one that can be found in Nest Protect, LIFX, and Amazon Dash\) alongside a powerful STM32 ARM Cortex M3 microcontroller\. It's like the Spark Core\. But better\.
