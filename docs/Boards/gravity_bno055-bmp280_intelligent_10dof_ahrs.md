## Description

INTRODUCTION

BNO055 is a new sensor IC for implementing an intelligent 9\-axis Absolute Orientation Sensor\. It is a system in package, integrating a triaxial 14\-bit accelerometer, a triaxial 16\-bit gyroscope, a triaxial geomagnetic sensor and a 32\-bit microcontroller\. At just 5\.2 x 3\.8 x 1\.1 mm³, it is significantly smaller than comparable discrete or system\-on\-board solutions and also is the sensor\-hub product of the smallest size that supports Windows 8\.1 at present\. BNO055 is able to provide not only single data of the three kinds of sensors \(accelerometer/gyroscope/geomagnetic\), but also integrated data, such as quaternions, Euler angles or vectors\. Besides, the built\-in MCU frees the users from the complexities of algorithm processing, which provides application support in many aspects for smart phone, wearable device and so on\.



BMP280 is an absolute barometric pressure sensor especially designed for mobile applications, which can realize the measurement of barometric pressure and temperature\(the data can be converted into altitude through the specific formula\)\. The sensor module is housed in an extremely compact package\. It is based on Bosch’s proven Piezo resistive pressure sensor technology featuring high accuracy and linearity as well as long term stability and high EMC robustness\. Numerous device operation options offer highest flexibility to optimize the device regarding power consumption, resolution and filter performance\.



Now, this sensor module integrates BNO055 and BMP280 on one board to combine the two sensor into a 10DOF sensor module\. The standard Gravity\-I2C interface eases the integration process for customers, freeing them from the complexities of multivendor solutions so they can spend more time on product innovation, including novel applications such as wearable hardware\. It is also the perfect choice for augmented reality, more immersive gaming, personal health and fitness, indoor navigation and any other application requiring context awareness\.
