## Description

DESCRIPTION

Wow that's a tiny GPS antenna\! This passive antenna is only 15mm x 15mm x 6\.8mm in size, with a 50mm long uFL cable\. Great for when you want to keep things small\.



Comes with a standard uFL connector on the end\. Perfect for our FONA 808\! Not good for our Ultimate GPS breakouts/shields/hat as those are designed for active antennas\.



This is the 15mm version \- we also have a smaller 9mm uFL GPS Antenna\.
