## Description

The Dreamer Nano V4\.0 is a surface mount breadboard embedded version of the ATMEGA 32U4 with integrated Micro USB\. It has everything that Leonardo has \(electrically\)\.Physically, it is just missing power jack to save space\.



Using the ATmega32U4 as its sole microcontroller allows it to be cheaper and simpler\. Also, because the 32U4 is handling the USB directly, code libraries are available which allow the board to emulate a computer keyboard, mouse, and more using the USB\-HID protocol\!
