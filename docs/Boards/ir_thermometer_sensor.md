## Description

Melexis' MLX90614ESF\-BAA is an infrared thermometer designed for non\-contact temperature sensing\. An internal 17\-bit ADC and a powerful DSP contribute to the MLX90614’s high accuracy and resolution\. It has a huge number of applications including body temperature measurment and movement detection\.



The MLX90614 provides two methods of output: PWM and SMBus \(i\.e\. TWI, I2C\)\. The 10\-bit PWM output provides a resolution of 0\.14°C, while the TWI interface has a resolution of 0\.02°C\. The MLX90614 is factory calibrated in wide temperature ranges: \-40 to 85°C for the ambient temperature and \-70 to 382\.2°C for the object temperature\. The measured value is the average temperature of all objects in the Field Of View of the sensor\. The MLX90614 offers a standard accuracy of 0\.5°C around room temperatures\.



This devices comes in an industry standard TO\-39 package\. We’re carrying the 3V version of this sensor\.
