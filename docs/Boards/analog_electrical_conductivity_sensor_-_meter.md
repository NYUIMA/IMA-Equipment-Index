## Description

Why measure EC \(Electrical Conductivity\) ? The salinity of the soil, irrigation water systems or fertilizer solutions is an important parameter affecting the root zone environment of  plants\. Any of these factors can have a significant effect on plant growth and quality\. The presence of high salt levels is your warning sign to make adjustments\. Low\-salt levels could lead to nutrient deficiencies\. Don’t wait for trouble, measure before the damage shows in your plants\. In terms of liquid, we often use the reciprocal of resistance, which is conductance, as a measurement\. The conductivity of water can reflect the level of electrolytes present in the water\. Depending on the concentration of the electrolyte, the conductivity of the aqueous solution is different\.





This Analog EC Meter is unique\. It is designed specially for Arduino controllers and has built\-in simple, convenient and practical features\. After simple connections according to our diagram and uploading the program, you will be able to measure the EC value easily\.





To ease the difficulty of using this sensor,  a Gravity\(https://www\.dfrobot\.com/gravity\) Interface is adapted to allow plug&play\.  The Arduino IO expansion shield\(https://www\.dfrobot\.com/product\-1009\.html\) is the best match for this senor connecting to your Arduino\(https://www\.dfrobot\.com/category\-104\.html\)\. As this sensor can work at 3\.3V which makes it compatible with Raspberry Pi\(https://www\.dfrobot\.com/category\-157\.html\), intel edison\(https://www\.dfrobot\.com/category\-187\.html\), joule and curie\.
