## Description

The Q Touch Sensor is a high sensitivity and high noise immunity touch input device\.It is based on Atmel AT42QT1070\. The AT42QT1070 modulates its bursts in a spread\-spectrum fashion in order to heavily suppress the effects of external noise, and to suppress RF emissions\. The QT1070 uses a dual\-pulse method of acquisition\. This provides greater noise immunity and eliminates the need for external sampling capacitors, allowing touch sensing using a single pin\.
