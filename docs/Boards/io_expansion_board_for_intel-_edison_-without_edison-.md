## Description

IO Expansion Board is one of the market favourites\. Fast robotics prototyping made affordable and simple thanks to this design\. Soldering and wiring often becomes a problem when a bridged connection happens and components break sometimes, increasing time and cost\. The IO Expansion Shield for Edison extends Edison's powerful scope into sensing the physical world, and prepares it ready for interaction through wireless communication\. This IO expansion board for Edison is compatible with Arduino open source platform and Linux, and supports Java and C development environment\. It can also be used as a standalone communication platform for software like flash, processing, Max/MSP and VVVV\.
