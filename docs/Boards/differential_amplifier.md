## Description

Find setting up an amplifier IC on the breadboard a troublesome and totally no\-need\-to\-repeat job? This Grove module can save you clutter to settle up such an IC by integrating the whole operating circuit\. It's designed for precise differential\-input amplification\. Input the differential signals of your sensor to this module through the male pins, then your Arduino will get a precisely amplified output from the Grove interface\. The gain scale factor is selectable\. You can get a 304 times or 971 times amplification via a switch on the board\.
