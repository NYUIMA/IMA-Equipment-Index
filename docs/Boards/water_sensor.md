## Description

This water sensor module is part of the Twig system\. This sensor works by having a series of exposed traces connected to ground and interlaced between the grounded traces are the sens traces\. The sensor traces have a weak pull\-up resistor of 1 MÎ©\. The resistor will pull the sensor trace value high until a drop of water shorts the sensor trace to the grounded trace\. Believe it or not this circuit will work with the digital I/O pins of your Arduino or you can use it with the analog pins to detect the amount of water induced contact between the grounded and sensor traces\.
