## Description

This slide potentiometer is a linear variable resistor with a total resistance of 10k\. When you move the lever from one side to the other, its output voltage will range between 0 V to the VCC you apply\. Three of four Grove pins are connected to VCC, GND and the ADC IN on the slide, while the remaining pin is connected to a green indicator LED\. You can use the indicator LED to visually display the change on the potentiometer\.
