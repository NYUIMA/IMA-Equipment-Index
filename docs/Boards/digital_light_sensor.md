## Description

This module is based on the I2C light\-to\-digital converter TSL2561 to transform light intensity to a digital signal\. Different from traditional analog light sensor, as Grove \- Light Sensor\(http://www\.seeedstudio\.com/depot/grove\-light\-sensorp\-p\-1253\.html?cPath=144\_148\), this digital module features a selectable light spectrum range due to its dual light sensitive diodes: infrared and full spectrum\.
