## Description

The Infrared Receiver is used to receive infrared signals and also used for remote control detection\. There is a IR detector on the Infrared Receiver which is used to get the infrared light emitted by the Infrared Emitter\. The IR detector have a demodulator inside that looks for modulated IR at 38 KHz\. The Infrared Receiver can receive signals well within 10 meters\. If more than 10 meters , the receiver may not get the signals\. We often use the two Twigs\-the Infrared Receiver and the Infrared Emitter to work together\.
