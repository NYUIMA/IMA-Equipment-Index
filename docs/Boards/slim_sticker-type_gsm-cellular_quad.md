## Description

DESCRIPTION

That's one slim cellular antenna\! At just 75mm long from tip to tip and and with a thickness of just 2mm, this 3dBi GSM antenna is slim, compact and sensitive, with a 3dBi gain\.  The antenna juts out from its base with stick\-on back so you attach it to an enclosure if you're making something like, say, a DIY phone\.  It has a tiny uFL connector on the end \- which is perfect for the FONA \- but will also work well for any other RF project on the 850/900/1800/1900/2100 bands, such as any other Cellular or GSM/GPRS device\.



We also offer a version of this antenna with a longer 300mm cable\.
