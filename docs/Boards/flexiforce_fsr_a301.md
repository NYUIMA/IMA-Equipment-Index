# FlexiForce FSR A301

![flexiforce_fsr_a301](/img/boards/flexiforce_fsr_a301.png)

## Basic information

**Brand**: Tekscan

**Model**: A301

**Product page**: [https://www.tekscan.com/products-solutions/force-sensor...](https://www.tekscan.com/products-solutions/force-sensors/a301?tab=related-electronics)

**Documentation**: [https://www.tekscan.com/sites/default/files/resources/F...](https://www.tekscan.com/sites/default/files/resources/FLX-A301-F-Redesign_1.pdf)

## Description

The A301 is optimized for high volume manufacturing and ideal for embedding into products and applications\.



The sensors are available in three force ranges: Low 4\.4 N \(0 \- 1 lb\), Medium 111 N \(0 \- 25 lb\) and High 445 N \(0 \- 100 lb\)\*\. The force ranges stated are approximations\. The dynamic range of this small force sensor can be modified by changing the drive voltage and adjusting the resistance of the feedback resistor\.



How to Adjust the Force Range:

\*In order to measure higher forces, apply a lower drive voltage \(\-0\.5 V, \-0\.10 V, etc\.\) and reduce the resistance of the feedback resistor \(1kΩ min\.\) To measure lower forces, apply a higher drive voltage and increase the resistance of the feedback resistor\. For an alternative to the recommended circuit, see the Related Electronicstab\.
