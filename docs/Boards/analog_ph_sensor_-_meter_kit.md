## Description

Need to measure water quality and other parameters but haven't got any low cost pH meter? Find it difficult to use with Arduino? DFRobot analog pH meter, specially designed for Arduino controllers and has convenient and practical "Gravity"\(https://www\.dfrobot\.com/gravity\) connector and a bunch of features\. Instant connection to your probe an your Arduino to get pH measurements at ± 0\.1pH \(25 ℃\)\. For most hobbyist this great accuracy range and it's low cost makes this a great tool for biorobotics and other projects\! It has an LED which works as the Power Indicator, a BNC connector and PH2\.0 sensor interface\. To use it, just connect the pH sensor with BND connector, and plug the PH2\.0 interface into the analog input port of any Arduino controller\(https://www\.dfrobot\.com/category\-104\.html\)\. If pre\-programmed, you will get the pH value easily\. Comes in compact plastic box with foams for better mobile storage\.



Build your own PH meter gadjet, or a water monitoring station for your water tanks\. This and our other water sensor devices\(https://www\.dfrobot\.com/category\-68\.html\) could make for the ultimate water control device\. Use it for your  aquaponics or fish tanks or other materials that need measurements\.



 

This is a laboratorial probe, it can't be immersed in the liquid for too long time\. You can check here for the whole Analog pH Sensor / Meter Pro Kit For Arduino\(https://www\.dfrobot\.com/product\-1110\.html\) or a spare Industrial Probe\(https://www\.dfrobot\.com/product\-1074\.html\) as replacement



What is pH?



“pH stands for power of hydrogen, which is a measurement of the hydrogen ion concentration in the body\. The total pH scale ranges from 1 to 14, with 7 considered to be neutral\. A pH less than 7 is said to be acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic or alkaline\.”
