## Description

Genuino Micro is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega32u4, developed in conjunction with Adafruit\. It has 20 digital input/output pins \(of which 7 can be used as PWM outputs and 12 as analog inputs\), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a micro USB connection, an ICSP header and a reset button\. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a micro USB cable to get started\. It has a form factor that enables it to be easily placed on a breadboard\.



The Micro is similar to the Leonardo in that the ATmega32u4 has built\-in USB communication, eliminating the need for a secondary processor\. This allows the Micro to appear to a connected computer as a mouse and keyboard, in addition to a virtual \(CDC\) serial / COM port\.
