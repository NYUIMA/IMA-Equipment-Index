## Description

The XL6009 DC / DC step\-up voltage stabilizer is assembled as a module based on the XL6009 chip\. The board has a tuning, a lot of revolving resistor for accurately setting the output voltage\. The converter increases the input DC voltage from 3 to 32V with an output voltage regulator in the range from 5 to 35V\. This converter of modular type can be used as a small power supply, battery charger, power a variety of electronic devices\. Such a converter is a good solution for powering circuits with a greater difference between the input and stabilized voltage \(voltage drop\)\. The module has low current consumption and low heat generation\. To connect the input and output voltage, the converter has two terminals of the following purpose:

 IN \+ and IN\-: input voltage 3 \- 32 V

 OUT \+ and OUT\-: output voltage 5 \- 35 V
