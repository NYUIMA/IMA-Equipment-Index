## Description

DESCRIPTION

For advanced NeoPixel fans, we how have a bendable, Flexible 8x8 NeoPixel LED Matrix\! Control all 64 ultra\-bright LEDs using a single microcontroller pin, set each LED as you wish to scroll messages or draw little images\. This matrix has a thick flexible PCB backing that can be gently bent and curved around surfaces



You can use this matrix just like any other NeoPixel\-compatible product\.



With 64 LEDs, you can have up to 4A of current draw if all the LEDs are on bright white\. You can use our 5V 4A, 5V 2A or even a 5V 10A power supply\. For portable use, if you are drawing less than 3A, try out this 5V@3A UBEC,



We also have a flexible NeoPixel Matrix in 8x32 if you love that 4:1 aspect ratio and in bigger 16x16\.



Please note: Flexible PCBs are not designed for repeated flexing\! While we think this product may work in wearables or other situations where the matrix is bent around, we do not offer any guarantees or refunds if you end up cracking the LEDs or traces\! This is for advanced users only, who already know how to use NeoPixels and are comfortable with the high current requirements and protecting the matrix from damage\. There are no returns, refunds or replacements for damaged product\. You cannot cut these panels into custom shapes as data/power lines run through the entire body of the PCB\.
