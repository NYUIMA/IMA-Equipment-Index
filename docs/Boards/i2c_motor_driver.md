## Basic information

**Brand**: Grove

**Product page**: [https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-I2C-Motor-Driver-p-90...](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-I2C-Motor-Driver-p-907.html)

**Documentation**: [http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-I2C_Motor_Driver_V1.3...](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-I2C_Motor_Driver_V1.3/)

## Description

Its heart is a dual channel H\-bridge driver chip that can handle current up to 2A per channel, controlled by an Atmel ATmega8L which handles the I2C communication with for example an Arduino\. Both motors can be driven simultaneously while set to a different speed and direction\. It can power two brushed DC motors or one 4\-wire two\-phase stepper motor\. It requires a 6V to 15V power supply to power the motor and has an onboard 5V voltage regulator which can power the I2C bus \(selectable by jumper\)\. All driver lines are diode protected from back EMF\.



Â 

The easy software interface is not the only easy\-to\-use feature because the I2C motor driver is designed to get you up and running in notime\. It features a LED for power and four LED's to indicate if and to which direction each motor is running\. Screw terminals facilitate motor and power connections, and the GROVE system plug and I2C interface enables you to daisy\-chain the driver with many other devices\.
