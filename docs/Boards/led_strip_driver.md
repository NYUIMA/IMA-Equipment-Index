![led_strip_driver](/img/boards/led_strip_driver.png)

## Basic information

**Brand**: Grove

**Product page**: [https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-LED-Strip-Driver-p-11...](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-LED-Strip-Driver-p-1197.html)

**Documentation**: [http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-LED_Strip_Driver/](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-LED_Strip_Driver/)

## Description

The LED Strip Driver with 4\-pin Grove interface provides easy connectivity to your standard Arduino device or Seeed Stalker\. It can help you control the luminance of a single\-color LED strip, as well as the color and the luminance of an RGB LED strip through Arduino or Seeeduino\.

 

It has 2 terminals and 2 Grove interfaces\. The power for the LED strip comes in through the 2\-pin terminal\. And the LED controlling voltages output through the 4\-pin terminal\. The 2 Grove interfaces are respectively screen\-printed “IN” \(for controlling data input\) and “OUT” \(for controlling data shared with the next strip driver\)\.

 

It can drive an LED strip 1 to 2 meters long with 9 V, while 1 to 5 meters long with 12 V\.  The driver in conjunction with the colorful LED strips can add a wonderful effect to indoor or outdoor usages\.
