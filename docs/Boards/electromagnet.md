## Description

Description

An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by electric current\. An electric current flowing in a wire creates a magnetic field around the wire, due to Ampere's law\(see drawing below\)\. To concentrate the magnetic field, in an electromagnet the wire is wound into a coil with many turns of wire lying side by side\. The magnetic field of all the turns of wire passes through the center of the coil, creating a strong magnetic field there\. Grove \- Electromagnet can shuck 1KG weight and hold on\. it easy to use, to learn electromagnet principle\.
