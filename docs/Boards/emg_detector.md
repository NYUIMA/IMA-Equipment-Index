Grove Compatible

3\.5mm Connector

6 Disposable Surface Electrodes

Power supply voltage: 3\.3V\-5V

1000mm Cable Leads

No additional power supply

 

Move 

When finish downloading demo code, it'll take about 5s to initialize, you should keep static when initializing\.

You can see that when initializing, the Led Bar will go form level 10 to level 0\. When Led Bar All off, you can move now\.
