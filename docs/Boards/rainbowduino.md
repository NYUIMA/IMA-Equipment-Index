## Basic information

**Brand**: Rainbowduino

**Product page**: [https://www.seeedstudio.com/Rainbowduino-LED-driver-pla...](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Rainbowduino-LED-driver-platform-Atmega-328-p-371.html)

**Documentation**: [http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Rainbowduino/](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Rainbowduino/)

## Description

The Rainbowduino board \(V3\.0\) is an Arduino compatible controller board with professional multiplexed LED driver\. It can drive a 8x8 RGB Led Matrix or a 4x4x4 RGB LED Cube in common Anode mode\. Rainbowduino v3\.0 uses two MY9221 chips which is a 12\-channels \(R/G/B x 4\) constant current Adaptive Pulse Density Modulation\(APDM\)\. Rainbowduino v3\.0 has provisions for cascading more such boards with I2C interface\.

Rainbowduino v3\.0 is flashed with Arduino boot\-loader and this makes it easy to program sketches using Arduino IDE\. Unlike other LED drivers, this comes with a USB to UART \(FT232RL\) inbuilt for programming the sketches\.
