## Description

The reflectivity of infrared light varies with the color and distance of the reflecting surface\. According to this principle, Grove \- Infrared Reflective Sensor utilizes a RPR220 reflective photosensor module to detect color and distance\. When a light\-colored object approaches,the signal intensity received by infrared reflective sensor increases and the indicator LED on board turns red\. When a dark\-colored object approaches, the intensity decreases and the LED turns off\.

This sensor is a basic and widely used part in applications such as line\-following cars, rotary speed detection, auto data logging on utility meters or other situations where color or distance contrast is sharp\.
