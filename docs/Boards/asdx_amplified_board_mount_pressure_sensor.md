## Description

Overview

Pressure Ranges



±5 inH20, ±10 inH20

1 psi to 100 psi

The ASDX is a silicon pressure sensor offering either an I2C or SPI digital interface for reading pressure over the specified full scale pressure span and temperature range\.



The ASDX is fully calibrated and temperature compensated for sensor offset, sensitivity, temperature effects and non\-linearity using an on\-board Application Specific Integrated Circuit \(ASIC\)\. Calibrated output values for pressure are updated at approximately 1 kHz\.



The standard ASDX is calibrated over the temperature range of 0 °C to 85 °C \[32 °F to 185 °F\]\. The sensor is characterized for operation from a single power supply of either 3\.3 Vdc or 5\.0 Vdc\.



These sensors are available to measure absolute, differential and gage pressures\. The absolute versions have an internal vacuum reference and an output value proportional to absolute pressure\. Differential versions allow application of pressure to either side of the sensing diaphragm\. Gage versions are referenced to atmospheric pressure and provide an output proportional to pressure variations from atmosphere\.



The ASDX Series sensors are intended for use with non\-corrosive, non\-ionic working fluids such as air and dry gases\. They are designed and manufactured according to standards in ISO 9001\.
