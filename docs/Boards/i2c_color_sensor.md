## Description

This module is based on the color sensor TCS3414CS with digital output I2C\. Based on the 8\*2 array of filtered photodiodes and 16\-bits analog\-to\-digital converters, you can gain the color chromaticity of ambient light or the color of objects\. Of the 16 photodiodes, 4 have red filters, 4 have green filters, 4 have blue filters and 4 have no filter\(clear\)\. With the synchronization input pin, external pulsed light source can provides precise synchronous conversion control\.
