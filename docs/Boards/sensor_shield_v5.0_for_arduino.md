## Description

Description:

The latest Arduino Controller Sensor Shield V5\.0 is producted by ALSRobot\. This Sensor Shield expansion board to retains the advantages of version V4\.0 on the basis of stack design, PCB Immersion Gold processing technology\.newly added many kind of interface,for example,IIC interface、32 channels servo motor interface、bluetooth communication module interface、SD Card communication module interface and so on,more convenient\.



Sensor Shield allows you to connect to various modules like sensors, servos, relays, buttons, potentiometersEach functional module has buckled port with VCC, GND and Output, which has corresponding port on the Sensor Shield, connected with a plain 2\.54mm dual\-female cable you may start playing already\. Buckled brick cables are like cement for bricks, make the connections easier, secure and more professional looking\.

You can easily connect with usual analog sensors by using this expansion board, such as ray sensor\.if you support by this expansion board and corresponding circuit module,you only need to combine arduino and sensors module by using special cables, because concrete circuit details achieve by corresponding sensors module, so you only need to consider that how to read data coming from the sensor by program in arduino\.

For Arduino beginners, you do not have a headache for the cumbersome and complex circuit connection, the sensor extends the true sense of the board to simplify the circuit which can easily connect the commonly used sensor, a sensor requires only a common 3P sensor cable \(regardless of digital cable and analog cable\), after the completion of the circuit connection, the preparation of the corresponding Arduino program downloaded to the Arduino Duemilanove controller reads the sensor data, or receive wireless module to return data after computing the final easy to complete your own interactive works\.
