## Description

The new generation "Beetle" controller derives its core notion from minimalism without compromising functionality\. It comes with Atmel AtMega32u4 \(datasheet\) @16MHz clock time and has expanded amounts of interfaces: 10 digital pins, 5 analog pins and 4 pwn pins\. To further make it user\-friendly, it is compatible with Micro USB so that direct programming and testing is no longer a headache\. Select "Arduino Leonardo \(tools \>board \> Arduino Leonardo in Arduino IDE\), the ATmega32U4 comes preburned with a bootloader that allows you to upload any new code that is applicable to Arduino Leonardo\.



As a minimalized version of Arduino Leonardo, it enjoys similar powerful functionalities\. Beetle aims to solve problems of low\-cost controller, ease\-of\-using properly, and to provide a low cost solution for disposable projects, such as DIY projects, workshops, gift projects, E\-Textiles and educational\. For students and makers who can not afford too much on hardware purchasing, Beetle can be a great solution for them\.
