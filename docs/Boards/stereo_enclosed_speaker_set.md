## Description

DESCRIPTION

Listen up\! This set of two 2\.8" x 1\.2" speakers are the perfect addition to any audio project where you need 4 ohm impedance and 3W or less of power\. We particularly like these speakers as they are small and enclosed for good audio volume and quality\. The pair have a handy SPK input cable to add audio to your displays \(the connectors are similar to the JST\-PH series\(http://www\.digikey\.com/catalog/en/partgroup/ph\-series/2825\) which is ~2\.0mm spacing\)\.



We're specifically carrying these to use with our 10\.1 inch\(http://www\.adafruit\.com/products/1694\), 7 inch\(http://www\.adafruit\.com/products/1726\), or 5\.6 inch 1280x800 Display w/ Audio\(http://www\.adafruit\.com/products/1695\) driver boards\. However, they work peachy\-keen with any of our audio amps as well, such as the MAX98306\(http://www\.adafruit\.com/products/987\), TS2012\(http://www\.adafruit\.com/products/1552\) or TPA2016\(http://www\.adafruit\.com/products/1712\) stereo class D amplifiers\.
