## Basic information

**Brand**: Tekscan

**Model**: A201

**Product page**: [https://www.tekscan.com/products-solutions/force-sensor...](https://www.tekscan.com/products-solutions/force-sensors/a201)

**Documentation**: [https://www.tekscan.com/sites/default/files/resources/F...](https://www.tekscan.com/sites/default/files/resources/FLX-A201-F%20-%20Redesign_0.pdf)

## Description

A201 sensors are trimmable and have a 3\-pin male connector\. The sensors are available in three force ranges: Low 4\.4 N \(0 \- 1 lb\), Medium 111 N \(0 \- 25 lb\) and High 445 N \(0 \- 100 lb\)\*\. The force ranges stated are approximations\. The dynamic range of this small, versatile force sensor can be modified by changing the drive voltage and adjusting the resistance of the feedback resistor\.



How to Adjust the Force Range:

\*In order to measure forces above 100 lb \(up to 1000 lb\), apply a lower drive voltage \(\-0\.5 V,\-0\.10 V, etc\.\) and reduce the resistance of the feedback resistor \(1kΩ min\.\) Conversely, the sensitivity can be increased for measurement of lower forces by increasing the drive voltage or resistance of the feedback resistor\. For an alternative to the recommended circuit, see the Related Electronics tab\.







Typical Performance

Linearity \(Error\):  \< ±3% \(Line drawn from 0 to 50% load\)



Repeatability:  \< ±2\.5% of Full Scale \(Conditioned Sensor, 80% of Full Force Applied\)



Hysteresis:  \< 4\.5 % of Full Scale \(Conditioned Sensor, 80% of Full Force Applied\)



Drift:  \<5% / logarithmic time \(Constant Load of 25lb \(111 N\)\)



Response Time:  \< 5 µsec \(Time required for the sensor to respond to an input force; Impact load \- recorded on Oscilloscope\)



Operating Temperature:  \-40°C \- 60°C \(\-40°F \- 140°F\)\*



\* Force reading change per degree of temperature change = 0\.36%/ºC \(±0\.2%/ºF\)
