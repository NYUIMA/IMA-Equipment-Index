# Sharp Infrared Distance Sensor (100-550cm)

![sharp_infrared_distance_sensor_-100-550cm-](/img/boards/sharp_infrared_distance_sensor_-100-550cm-.png)

## Basic information

**Brand**: DFRobot

**Product page**: [https://www.dfrobot.com/product-447.html](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-447.html)

**Documentation**: [https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/Sharp_GP2Y0A710K...](https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/Sharp_GP2Y0A710K_Distance_Sensor_(100-550cm)_SKU:_SEN0085)

## Description

The GP2Y0A710K infrared sensor is a new version of GP2Y0A700K which takes a continuous distance reading and reports the distance as an analog voltage with a distance range of 1m \(39\.3"\) to 5\.5m \(216\.5"\)\.



The interface is 5\-wire JST connector \(included with pins\) with dual Vcc, dual Gnd, and a single output voltage\. Power, ground and signal wiring is enough to read a continuous analog voltage representing distance\. A software lookup table can be implemented to translate the voltages to distances\.
