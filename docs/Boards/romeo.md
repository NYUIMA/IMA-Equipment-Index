**Documentation**: [https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/DFRduino_Romeo-A...](https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/DFRduino_Romeo-All_in_one_Controller_V1.1(SKU:DFR0004))

## Description

Romeo is an All\-in\-One Arduino compatible microcontroller especially designed for robotics applications from DFRobot\. It benefits from the Arduino open source platform, it is supported by thousands of open source codes, and can easily be expanded with your Arduino\-comaptible shields\. The integrated 2 way DC motor driver and wireless socket allows you to start your project immediatly without the need for an additional motor driver or wirless shield\.

Version History

Romeo v1\.1

The Romeo v1\.1 behaves like standard Arduino Uno which means you can program it directly from the Arduino IDE\. This v1\.1 version has changed the position ICSP pins to make the Romeo compatible with the USB host shield and the Ethernet shield\. That means now the Romeo could work perfectly with most Arduino shields\.

The Romeo v1\.1 differs from the preceding boards in that it does not use the FTDI USB\-to\-serial driver chip\. Instead, it features the Atmega8U2 programmed as a USB\-to\-serial converter\. All the pins of the new Romeo use colored pin headers\(FIT0084\-R,FIT0084\-B,FIT0084\-G\)\.

Romeo v1\.2

Changed on analog wiring piles to be fully compatible with DFRobot v2 sensor series\.

Note: We commonly use Green for digital I/O; Blue for Analog I/O; Red for Power/Voltage
