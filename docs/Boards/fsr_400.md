## Description

The model 400 FSR is a single\-zone Force Sensing Resistor optimized for use in human touch control of electronic devices such as automotive electronics, medical systems, and in industrial and robotics applications\. FSRs are two\-wire devices\. They are robust polymer thick film \(PTF\) sensors that exhibit a decrease in resistance with increase in force applied to the surface of the sensor\. It has a 5\.1mm diameter active area and is available in 4 connection options\. Interlink Electronics FSR 400 series is part of the single\-zone Force Sensing Resistor family\.
