## Description

DESCRIPTION

\*BZZZZZZZZZZ\* Feel that? That's your little buzzing motor, and for any haptic feedback project you'll want to pick up a few of them\. These vibe motors are tiny discs, completely sealed up so they're easy to use and embed\.



Two wires are used to control/power the vibe\. Simply provide power from a battery or microcontroller pin \(red is positive, blue is negative\) and it will buzz away\. Works from 2V up to 5V, higher voltages result in more current draw but also a stronger vibration\.



If you want to reduce the current draw/strength \(for example, to control it directly from an Arduino pin\) try putting a resistor \(100 to 1000 ohms\) in series\. For full power control, a small PN2222 transistor can control a motor easily, some experimentation may be required\!
