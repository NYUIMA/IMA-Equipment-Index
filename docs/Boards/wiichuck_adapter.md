## Description

The WiiChuck Adapter is a small PCB that is designed to be inserted into the connector of a Nintendo Wii Nunchuck to provide access to all 4 wires of the remote\. The power, ground and two\-wire interface of the Nunchuck are all broken out to a 4\-pin 0\.1" pitch header\. Compared with standard WiiChuck, the DFRobot WiiChuck has extra 4 pins which allow you connect it to two devices\.



The Wii Nunchuck is loaded with features \-\- a 2\-axis joystick, two buttons and a 3 axis Â±2g accelerometer \-\- and any device capable of I2C can communicate with it\! The WiiChuck allows you to interface with the Nunchuck without making a mess and cutting the wires\.
