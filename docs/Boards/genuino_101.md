## Description

INTRODUCTION

Arduino 101 \(Genuino\)  is a learning and development board that delivers the performance and low\-power consumption of the Intel Curie Module with the simplicity of Arduino at an entry\-level price\.



It keeps the same robust form factor and peripheral list of the UNO with the addition of onboard Bluetooth LE capabilities and a 6\-axis accelerometer/gyro to help you easily expand your creativity into the connected world\.



The module contains two tiny cores, an x86 \(Quark\) and an ARC, both clocked at 32MHz\. The Quark core runs ViperOS RTOS and helps the Arduino core to accomplish the most demanding tasks\. It comes with 14 digital input/output pins \(of which 4 can be used as PWM outputs\), 6 analog inputs, a USB connector for serial communication and sketch upload, a power jack, an ICSP header with SPI signals and I2C dedicated pins\.



The board operating voltage and I/O is 3\.3V but all pins are protected against 5V overvoltage\.



Here is a brief introduction of Arduino 101, check it out\.



The Arduino 101 has been designed in collaboration with Intel\.
