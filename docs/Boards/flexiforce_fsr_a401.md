## Description

The A401 has a 2\-pin connector\. This is our standard sensor with the largest sensing area: 25\.4 mm \(1 in\.\)\. A401 sensors are available in one force range: 111 N \(0 \- 25 lb\)\.\* The force ranges stated are approximations\. The dynamic range of this large force sensor can be modified by changing the drive voltage and adjusting the resistance of the feedback resistor\.



How to Adjust the Force Range:

\* Measurement ranges of 0\-1 lb and 0\-7000 lb are achievable with the A401 sensor by utilizing the recommended circuitry\. The force range can be extended by reducing the drive voltage, VT, or the resistance value of the feedback resistor, RF\. Conversely, the sensitivity can be increased for measurement of lower forces by increasing VT or RF\. For an alternative to the recommended circuit, see the Related Electronics tab\.



Typical Performance

Linearity \(Error\): \< ±3% \(Line drawn from 0 to 50% load\)



Repeatability:  \< ±2\.5% of Full Scale \(Conditioned Sensor, 80% of Full Force Applied\)



Hysteresis:  \< 4\.5 % of Full Scale \(Conditioned Sensor, 80% of Full Force Applied\)



Drift:  \<5% / logarithmic time \(Constant Load of 25 lb \(111 N\)\)



Response Time:  \< 5 µsec \(Time required for the sensor to respond to an input force; Impact load \- recorded on Oscilloscope\)



Operating Temperature:  \-40°C \- 60°C \(\-40°F \- 140°F\)\*



\* Force reading change per degree of temperature change =  0\.36%/ºC \(±0\.2%/ºF\)
