## Description

What's Robot Gripper?



Robot Gripper is a simple and durable robotics kit that is great for "getting a grip" on pretty much any robotics project\.



Large Open\-Width



The Robot Gripper is capable of opening an impressive 3" \(67mm\) wide\. It enables you to grip items of various sizes according to your needs\.

Self\-locking & Anti\-Slippery



The self\-locking function of fingers, together with the anti\-slippery material added on the inner side of two fingers, protect objects it grips from falling off\.



Lightweight PVC Material



The gripper itself is made of light\-weight PVC material, while remaining heavy\-duty to grip items up to 1\.5KG as you want\.

Self\-Protection Design



Thanks to the built\-in fuse, the inner N20 screw motor of the gripper will automatically stop running when the gripper is fully open or closed\. This protects the screw motor from short\-circuits and over\-current, ensuring long\-time use of the gripper\.
