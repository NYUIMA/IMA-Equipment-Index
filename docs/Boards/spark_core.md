## Description

The Spark Core is an Arduino\-compatible, Wi\-Fi enabled, cloud\-powered development platform that makes creating internet\-connected hardware a breeze\.

 

This little board packs a punch: with a 72 MHz ARM Cortex M3, the best Wi\-Fi module on the market, wireless programming, and lots of pin outs and peripherals, there's nothing you can't build with the Core\.

 

Now we have Spark core with two connectors, Chip Antenna\(http://www\.seeedstudio\.com/depot/Spark\-Core\-p\-1495\.html?cPath=6\_7\) and u\.FL connector, Besides, we get Shield Shield\(http://www\.seeedstudio\.com/depot/Shield\-Shield\-for\-Spark\-Core\-p\-1837\.html\) that converts the foodprint and pins into Arduino, making it compatible with all of your existing Arduino Shields and accessories\. And we get Spark Maker Kit\(http://www\.seeedstudio\.com/depot/Spark\-Maker\-Kit\-WiFi\-CC3000\-p\-1836\.html\) which contains all the necessary hardware components to get you started with building simple Internet enabled projects\.
