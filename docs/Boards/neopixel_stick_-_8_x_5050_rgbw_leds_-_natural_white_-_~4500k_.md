## Description

DESCRIPTION

What is better than smart RGB LEDs? Smart RGB\+White LEDs\! These NeoPixel sticks now have 4 LEDs in them \(red, green, blue and white\) for excellent lighting effects\. These are fun and glowy, and you can control each LED individually\! Make your own little LED arrangement with this stick of NeoPixel LEDs\.



This is the Natural White RGBW version\. We also have this stick in Warm White, Cool White, and good ole RGB\!



The NeoPixel is 'split', one half is the RGB you know and love, the other half is a white LED with a yellow phosphor\. Unlit, it resembles an egg yolk\. Lit up these are insanely bright \(like ow my eye hurts\) and can be controlled with 8\-bit PWM per channel \(8 x 4 channels = 32\-bit color overall\)\. Great for adding lots of colorful \+ white dots to your project\!
