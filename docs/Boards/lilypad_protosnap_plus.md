## Description

The LilyPad ProtoSnap Plus Kit is an all\-in\-one e\-textile prototyping kit that has been specifically designed to make it as easy as possible to incorporate electronics into any of your garments or fabrics\. The included LilyPad ProtoSnap Plus is a sewable electronics powerhouse that you can use to explore circuits and programming, then break apart to make an interactive fabric or wearable project\. We have also included a USB cable, 110mAh LiPo battery, needle set and two conductive thread bobbins\. With all of these parts combined and the featured Activity Guide \(found in the Documents tab\), you will be able to plan and create fantastic projects in no time\!



At the center of the ProtoSnap Plus is the LilyPad USB Plus microcontroller, pre\-wired to a LilyPad board including a LilyPad Light Sensor, LilyPad Buzzer, LilyPad Button Board, four pairs of colored LilyPad LEDs and a LilyPad Slide Switch\. Because these components are connected together on the ProtoSnap board, you can test out your project ideas before you sew\. The ProtoSnap Plus also includes expansion ports that let you sew your wearables together or use alligator cables to easily connect external sensors and components\. After testing out your coding ideas using the attached LilyPad pieces, you can break apart the prototyping board and sew them into your project\!
