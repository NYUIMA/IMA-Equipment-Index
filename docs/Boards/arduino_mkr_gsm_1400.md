## Description

As IoT advances, more and more developers incline to develop projects through the existing IoT board that includes everything from processing units to wireless connectivity modules\. Good news, such kind of board\-\-MKR GSM 1400 board, is released by Arduino recently\. Based on the Atmel SAMD21 and a SARAU201 GSM module, the board adopts a Cortex\-M0 \+32bits microcontroller, USB serial Port for developing and debugging, and most importantly a pre\-integrated cellular modem compatible with global 2G and 3G GSM networks\. Whatâ€™s more, it combines the functionality of the zero and global GSM connectivity\. So this board would be the ideal solution for makers wanting to design IoT projects with minimal previous experience in networking\.

 If you are gonna build up an IoT application requiring battery supply, this board is what you need\. It is designed to power the board using a LiPo battery or external power source rated 5V via the onboard USB port\. Power source switching is done automatically\. The MKR GSM 1400 board features a good 32 bit computational power similar to the Zero board, the usual rich set of I/O interfaces, GSM communication and the ease of use of the Arduino Software \(IDE\) for code development and programming\.

 During cellular transmissions, the peak current required by the board will exceed 500mA\. This is in excess of what can be sourced by a standard USB port, so it is mandatory to have a 1500 mAh or higher LiPo battery plugged all the time, the current provided by the USB port will be supplemented by the battery\. When powering the board using VIN, a 5V power supply that can supply at least 2A is required\.
