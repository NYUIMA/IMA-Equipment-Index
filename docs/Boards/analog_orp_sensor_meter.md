## Description

In the ever\-increasing need and awareness for health and safety, water has become a focus point for proper disinfection treatment as aftereffects of industrialization can become a danger for contamination of water via direct contact\. Water is a critical control point of contact where proper treatment can greatly reduce these microbes, thereby reducing the chances of illness and pollution\.





While traditional ORP meters are hard to get or use, this Analog ORP Meter is a highly compact ORP monitoring system that fits into your Arduino\. This design configuration allows the user to accurately monitor ORP without having to add any additional circuitry or components to your design\. Communication with the Analog ORP Meter is done using only simple wiring and programing\.

ORP \(Oxidation\-Reduction Potential\) is a measure of the ability of oxidation and reduction of aqueous solution, characterization of oxidizing or reducing the relative degree\. Unlike a pH measurement that follows a logarithmic curve and therefore requires more calibration adjustments, ORP follows a linear relationship and does not need instrument adjustment as much as it needs electrode maintenance\. ORP has proven to be a reliable method of measuring water quality and provides the operator with a single value of measurement regardless of which product, commodity, operation, treatment or sanitizer is used, and regardless of varying field conditions or method by which chemical is applied\.
