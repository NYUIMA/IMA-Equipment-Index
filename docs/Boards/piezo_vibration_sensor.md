![piezo_vibration_sensor](/img/boards/piezo_vibration_sensor.png)

## Basic information

**Brand**: Sparkfun

**Product page**: [https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9196](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9196)

**Documentation**: [https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Flex/MSI-te...](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Flex/MSI-techman.pdf)

## Description

This basic piezo sensor from Measurement Specialties is often used for flex, touch, vibration and shock measurements\. A small AC and large voltage \(up to \+/\-90V\) is created when the film moves back and forth\. A simple resistor should get the voltage down to ADC levels\. Can also be used for impact sensing or a flexible switch\.



Comes with solderable crimp pins\.



Features:



Flexible PVDF Piezo Polymer Film

Wide dynamic range

Laminated for higher voltage output

0\.1" breadboard friendly leads
