## Description

The XBee Expansion Board is a compliant solution designed to meet low\-cost,Â low\-power wireless sensor networks with special needs\. The module is easy to use, low power consumption, and the provision of critical data between devices reliable transmission\. As the innovative design, XBee\-PRO can be in the range 2\-3 times beyond the standard ZigBee modules\. XBee\-PRO modules work in the ISM 2\.4 GHz frequency band\. The MaxStream's XBee \(1 mW\) Zigbee module is pin\-compatible\.



The Xbee module is widely used in the United States, Canada, Australia, Israel and Europe\. The establishment of RF communication does not require any configuration and the module's default configuration supports a wide range of data system applications\. You can also use a simple AT command to advanced configuration\. An OEM developer is now XBee code development package\. It is self\-developed in collaboration with the MaxStream ZigBee/802\.15\.4 RF module code\.







Note: Transparent communication with a leonardo board its not compatible, for more information check our wiki page\.
