## Description

The Intel® RealSense™ Depth Camera D400 Series uses stereo vision to calculate depth\. The D435 is a USB\-powered depth camera and consists of a pair of depth sensors, RGB sensor, and infrared projector\. It is ideal for makers and developers to add depth perception capability to their prototype\.

 

 A powerful vision processor that uses 28 nanometer \(nm\) process technology and supports up to 5 MIPI Camera Serial Interface 2 lanes to compute real\-time depth images and accelerate output\.

 New advanced stereo depth algorithm for accurate depth perception\.

 A set of image sensors that enable capturing of disparity between images up to 1280 x 720 resolution\.

 Support for the cross\-platform, open\-source Intel® RealSense™ SDK 2\.0\.

 Dedicated color image signal processor for image adjustments and scaling color data\.

 Active infrared projector to illuminate objects to enhance the depth data\.
