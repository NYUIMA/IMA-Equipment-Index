## Description

The Canon EOS 6D DSLR Camera with EF 24\-105mm f/4L IS USM Lens Basic Kit from B&H combines a versatile full\-frame DSLR, wide\-angle to portrait\-length zoom lens, and a wide range of useful accessories to complement working with the 6D\. The basic kit includes a 16GB SDHC Class 10 UHS\-I memory card, an LCD screen protector, a bottle of lens cleaning fluid, a microfiber cleaning cloth, multicoated UV and circular polarizer filters, a wireless remote shutter release control, and a camera bag to house all of the kit components\.



The EOS 6D features a full\-frame 20\.2MP CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5\+ image processor to produce an impressive image quality with notable low\-light sensitivity to an expanded ISO 102400\. The processor also affords a wealth of speed throughout the camera system, including full HD 1080p video recording at 30 fps and a continuous shooting rate up to 4\.5 fps in full resolution\. The 6D utilizes an 11\-point autofocus system, with one center cross\-type point, to quickly and accurately acquire focus and an iFCL 63\-zone dual layer metering sensor utilizes the AF system as well as color and luminance values to determine precise exposure readings\. A 3\.0" 1,040k\-dot LCD monitor is available for bright, clear live view monitoring, image playback, and menu navigation for employing a host of image modes as well as for employing built\-in Wi\-Fi and GPS technologies\.



Also included with this kit is Canon's EF 24\-105mm f/4L IS USM lens, which provides a useful range of focal lengths to suit working in a wide variety of situations\. It features Image Stabilizer Technology for minimizing the appearance of camera shake by up to three stops and is constructed with one Super\-UD glass element and three aspherical lenses for reduced chromatic aberrations and high overall image clarity\. A ring\-type USM AF motor is also integrated into the lens' design to provide quick and quiet focusing performance that also supports full\-time manual focusing capabilities for fine tuning focus for selective focus applications\.
