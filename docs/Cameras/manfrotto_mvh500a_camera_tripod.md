## Description

A precise, reliable head combined with a lightweight yet robust tripod to form the perfect package\. The video head mounted in this system is the most compact in our successful Bridging Technology™ range\. The 500 fluid video head with flat base includes a sliding plate for extra easy fast set\-up and camera connection, it’s compact enough to slot into your case with ease, while fluid cartridges creates the smooth pan and tilt movements\. The side lock mechanism allows the camera and sliding plate to click quickly into the head from above, instead of needing to be aligned and slid in from the back\. The head features a fixed counterbalance system of 2\.4kg, and can support up to 5kg\. A 3/8'' easy link thread connection gives you the freedom to connect gear like an external monitor in a jiffy, and the flat base is ideal for attaching a variety of supports\. Support for the video head is provided by a MagFibre Video Tripod \- a hybrid two\-stage \(or 3\-section\), carbon fibre single leg\-tube tripod that’s compact and lightweight\. The clever design features a centre column with a built\-in levelling ball and bubble spirit level\. This allows the camera operator to level the camera without needing to make micro adjustments to each individual tripod leg\. In addition, the clever leg selectors give you a pre\-set leg angle so you can get set up even faster\. The combination of lightweight design, fast set up features and special levelling aids makes it the perfect tripod whether you are using it indoors or outdoors\. Tension\-adjustable flip leg levers make setting up and packing away the tripod into its supplied padded carry case both fast and easy\.
